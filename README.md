## Main React Components

- `SurveyRow` (in `SurveyRow.js`): shows how a Survey is rendered inside a `SurveyContainer.js`. It contains also the API call to get all the info regarding a survey, which are called when the button near a certain survey is pressed (If the user is logged in, it will fetch also the answer sheets related to a certain survey. After fetching it, the response from the back-end will be processed and setted as a state).
- `ModalInsertSurvey` (in `ModalInsertSurvey.js`): contains all the states regarding a specific question and handles the insertion of a specific question. It contains both the return methods for an open and a closed question.
- `InsertSurveyRow` (in `InsertSurveyRow.js`): shows how a question is rendered inside `InsertSurvey.js`. It contains also the methods to order a question (move up/move down) and to delete it.
- `ModalAnswerSheet` (in `ModalAnswerSheet.js`): handle the submission for a specific survey / shows the data regarding all the submissions that an admin received on one of his surveys.
- `AnswerSheetRow` (in `AnswerSheetRow.js`): renders all the questions for a specific survey and handles the state for each one of them, by managing an answer array state. 
- `API.js` (in `API.js`): contains all the API calls and the methods that communicate with the backend.
- `App.js` (in `APP.js`): handles the login/logout/checks if a user is logged in, uses API methods to get the surveys/the surveys for a specific admin and contains all the routes, while also rendering the main pages both for loggend and not-logged users.
